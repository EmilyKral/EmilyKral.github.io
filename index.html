                    <p>Hello! My name is Emily Kral, I am 23 years old and from the <span id='isleofwight-link' class='photo-link'>Isle of Wight</span>.</p>
                    <p>In July 2020 I <span id='graduate-link' class='photo-link'>graduated</span> from the University of York with a degree in Mathematics. In my third year of studying I took part in the Erasmus programme and <span id='spain-link' class='photo-link'>moved to Spain</span> for the year to study maths at the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid.</p>
                    <p>I am currently taking a Codecademy Career Path in Front End Development and am really enjoying it. When I was younger I wanted to be a graphic designer so this has been a lovely way to combine my interests in both STEM and design.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I love to bake <span id='cakes-link' class='photo-link'>very chocolatey cakes</span>, watch all sorts of films, and go on walks along the <span id='beach-link' class='photo-link'>beach near my house</span>. I used to be a <span id='swimming-link' class='photo-link'>competitive swimmer</span> and still swim regularly, just not nearly as fast.</p>
